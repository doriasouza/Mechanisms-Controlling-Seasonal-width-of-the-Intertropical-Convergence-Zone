This is the data for all the simulations used to implement the theoretical framework developed by Byrne and Schneider (2016). The data was generated using the width and theoretical framework code. Examples of this for the k=1 model can be found here. 

The data with the terms for the predictive multilinear regression line can be found in the excel file  Multilinear_regression_predictors. The regression lines for each of the simulation was calculated using the statsmodel linear regression function.
